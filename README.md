# Human-Following-Robot
This Arduino-based robot follows a human using IR sensors to detect hand movements and an ultrasonic sensor to maintain distance. It adjusts motor speed dynamically to turn and move towards the detected hand. Ideal for basic autonomous navigation and human interaction projects.
