# Human-Following-Robot
This Arduino-based human-following robot uses IR sensors to detect hand movements and an ultrasonic sensor to maintain a safe distance while dynamically adjusting motor speed for movement and turning. It consists of an Arduino UNO R3, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, IR sensors, an L298N motor driver, and DC motors. The IR sensors detect a handâ€™s position, making the robot turn left or right accordingly, while the ultrasonic sensor ensures it moves forward when an object is detected within 10 to 30 cm. If no object is detected, the robot stops. PWM signals control motor speed for smooth navigation. Setup involves connecting IR sensors to digital pins 2 and 3, the ultrasonic sensor to pins 11 and 12, and the motor driver to control motors, followed by uploading the Arduino code and testing movement based on hand gestures, making it ideal for basic autonomous navigation and human-interactive projects.
